# Monitor in Fabric Data warehouse overview

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-se-and-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-se-and-dw.md)]

Monitoring the usage and activity is crucial for ensuring that the data warehouse operates efficiently.

Fabric provides a set of tools to help you:

- Optimize query performance
- Gain insights into your Fabric capacity to determine when it's time to scale up or down
- Understand details about running and completed queries

## Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app

The Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app provides visibility into capacity usage of each warehouse allowing you to see the compute charges for all user-generated and system-generated T-SQL statements within a warehouse and SQL analytics endpoint. For more information on monitoring capacity usage, see [Billing and utilization reporting in Synapse Data Warehouse](usage-reporting.md).

## Dynamic management views (DMVs)

Users can get insights about their live connections, sessions, and requests by querying a set of dynamic management views (DMVs) with T-SQL. For more information, see [Monitor connections, sessions, and requests using DMVs](monitor-using-dmv.md).

## Query insights

Query Insights provides historical query data for completed, failed, canceled queries along with aggregated insights to help you tune your query performance. For more information, see [Query insights in Fabric data warehousing](query-insights.md).
